Pulse several times to mix thoroughly.Add the butter, and pulse several times until the butter is thoroughly incorporated and the texture resembles that of a coarse meal---you want the butter pieces to be in varying sizes, some small and others slightly larger. This will result in the flakiest crust.While pulsing, slowly add the water and continue to pulse until the dough just begins to clump together loosely.Remove the dough to a clean counter top, shape together with your hands into a square disc, and cover tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for 1 1/2 - 2 hours, or until firm (dough can be prepared up to three days in advance).Prepare Hand Pies:Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.In a bowl, combine the blueberries, lemon zest, lemon juice, cinnamon, and salt. Mix thoroughly. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the egg and water. Set aside with a pastry brush.Remove the pie dough from the fridge, and allow it to rest at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes. Once it has rested, place the dough on a lightly floured counter top. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 12\" x 15\" rectangle (don't worry if the edges are not perfectly straight). Using a pastry cutter or knife, cut the dough into six rectangles.Brush the edges of the pie dough rectangles with water. Distribute the blueberries evenly into the center of each rectangle, and fold the dough over. Use a fork to seal the edges.Place the hand pies onto the parchment lined baking sheet. Brush the the tops of the pies evenly with egg wash, and sprinkle with demerara sugar. Using a sharp knife, cut two to three small slits into the top of the pies (to allow steam to escape during baking).Bake at 375 degrees for 35-40 minutes (rotating halfway), or until the golden brown. Do not worry if some of the filling spills during baking, this is to be expected.Transfer baking sheet to a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Prepare Pie Dough","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a large food processor.

In a large bowl, beat the shortening and sugar with a standing or handheld electric mixer until fluffy. Add the molasses and beat until well blended. In another large bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, cloves, cinnamon, and ginger. Add one-third of the flour mixture to the molasses mixture and blend on the lowest speed. Add another third and blend in, then add the final third and blend in. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and leave on the counter overnight. (Letting the dough stand overnight allows the moisture to be evenly spread, which in turn ensures there are no wet spots that stick to the rolling pin or work surface and also that there are no dry spots that tear. This is vital for a dough that is rolled so thin.)2. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C).3. Take a handful of dough and shape it into an 8-inch disc, about 1 inch high, as you might do in making a pie crust, on a lightly floured work surface. (Bonnie uses a large flour sack that is well floured as a surface to roll out the dough. I think a floured pastry cloth will work perfectly.) Keep the rest of the dough tightly covered. Roll the dough. You want to use only the smallest amount of flour possible to keep the dough from sticking. This takes practice. Cookie dough that is rolled fairly thin (1/8 inch thickness, but not less), doesn’t spread much when rolled this thin and is ideal for intricate cut-out cookies.4. Cover a baking sheet with Silpat or parchment sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Cut the cookies with a 2 1/2-inch cookie cutter and place on the baking sheet, about 1 inch apart. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until edges just begin to color.5. Transfer the Silpat or parchment and the cookies to a wire rack to cool for 2 minutes, then transfer the cookies sans Silpat or parchment to a rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, beat the shortening and sugar with a standing or handheld electric mixer until fluffy.","ingredients":[{"id":4615,"name":"shortening","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/shortening.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404628,"name":"hand mixer","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/hand-mixer.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the molasses and beat until well blended.
